# Coding Interview Roadmap Progress

Welcome to my Coding Interview Roadmap Progress repository! ðŸ‘‹

This repository serves as a documentation of my journey as I follow the NeetCode Coding Interview roadmap, striving to enhance my problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews.

## Roadmap Overview

- **[Roadmap Link](https://neetcode.io/roadmap)**

## Progress Tracking

I'll be maintaining this repository regularly to log my progress. Here's how I plan to structure it:

### Topics Covered

#### Arrays & Hashing

- [ ] Contains Duplicate
- [ ] Valid Anagram
- [ ] Two Sum
- [ ] Group Anagrams
- [ ] Top K Frequent Elements
- [ ] Product of Array Except Self
- [ ] Valid Sudoku
- [ ] Encode and Decode Strings
- [ ] Longest Consecutive Sequence

#### Two Pointers

### Solutions

I'll be providing solutions to the problems I solve in the `solutions/[problem-category]` folder. Each problem will have its own file with a clear naming convention.

### Log

I'll maintain a log or journal for many problems (not every one though). Challenges faced, and key takeaways during my coding journey, will be documented in a markdown file with the same name as the problem and in the same folder.

## Road Ahead

I'll continue updating this repository as I progress through the roadmap. Excited to witness the improvements and challenges that lie ahead!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
